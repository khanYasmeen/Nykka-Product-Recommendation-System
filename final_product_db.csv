It is best to use on recent stretch marks that are red or pink (old scars are usually white).About the Brand: Blue Nectar is an Ayurvedic brand that uses high herbal quotient ingredients.

319,VLCC Ayush Men Moisturiser,"VLCC Ayush Men Moisturiser VLCC ayushMEN Range Dull, dark, patchy and dehydrated skin- the outcomes of stress, age and environmental damage is not only a women's concern today. Men too need specially formulated skin care products to keep skin woes away. In view of this recent paradigm shift in skin care regime for men which has become essential in today's day and age, VLCC presents AyushMEN range especially developed for men's skin. It includes range of Face Care products that target specific skin needs of men. Infused with naturally derived potent actives, these products when used regularly over time, help resolve all skin related worries of men! Why men need different and specialized skin care products? Thicker skin In general men have 25% thicker skin than women's skin and hence, need powerful ingredients that the skin absorbs well and leaves the skin clean, healthy and energized. Collagen Men also have higher levels of collagen in their skin than women do. Hence, men do not need as much collagen boosting as much women do! Collagen is known for slowing down aging process and reduces wrinkles but this does not mean that men do not need specialized skin care products. They also need as much as women do but ones that are specially formulated for them! Sebum Men's skin secretes much more oil called sebum than what women's skin does! As a result, a man's skin is more prone to blackheads, breakouts and acne. The skin also remains oily all the time, needing products that could battle sebum and maintain healthy, hydrated skin! Facial hair One of the major and common differences between men's and women's skin is the presence of facial hair. These facial hairs too have their positive and negative impacts. While they exfoliate the skin and keep it wrinkle free it can also lead to clogged pores and ingrown hairs. VLCC ayush MEN Moisturiser With Neem, Liquorice & Tulsi Extract and non-greasy formula, it provides all-day moisture plus skin brightening effect.Our unique non-greasy formula enriched with Ayurvedic herbs provides long lasting moisturization and resists harmful environmental conditions leaving your skin feeling nourished, revitalized and naturally fair. KEY INGREDIENTS & BENEFITSNeem: Its anti-bacterial properties works wonders for the skin as it prevents and cures skin infections, acne, excessive oil secretion and pigmentation.Liquorice Extract: Liquorice helps battle skin damaging free radicals. It also helps regulate skin oil protection making it an extremely efficient anti-acne ingredient.Tulsi Extract: Tulsi or the holy basil acts as a natural cleanser, gets rid of dead skin cells on the face and helps reduce blemishes as well.

593,Vaadi Herbals Lychee Lip Therapy,"Vaadi Herbals Lychee Lip Therapy PRO-TIP: Clean Lip Gently And Use Your Fingers To Apply The Lip Balm To Your Lips. Lip Balm - Lychee (10 gms) Finish: Moisturising Format: Lip Balm An excellent combination of herbal ingredients, this lip balm tempts you with its flavor; while pampering your lips with its deep moisturizing. It grants health and beauty to your lips; while keeping the skin well-protected! Why do Lips need extra care ? We wear layers of clothes to protect our self from extreme weather conditions, put on a lot of sun block to stay protected from the sun's UV rays but what about the lips? They are forever exposed, be it the winter chill or summer's skin burning air. Lips have a thinner layer of skin as compared to the skin on our body. Lips are sensitive to allergies, external factors, sun's UV rays and dirt. Lips need all the more protection to serve you better. After all, its the smile that makes the first impression. Why not make it an ever lasting one? How is Lychee effective for lips ? The evergreen Lychee (or Litchi) trees originated from the Fujian provinces of China and Guangdong. It is now grown in many parts of the world and is a common fruit in South Asia, Southeast Asia and Southern Africa. Lychee contains the one essential vitamin in abundance that the human body does not produce- Vitamin C. Lychee is highly rich in Vitamin C, Selenium, Potassium, Calcium and Vitamin B complex. Vitamin C keeps the lips safe from external factors such as pollution, extreme weather conditions, allergy, dryness and bleeding and makes the lips softer. The most important ingredient found in Lychee is Oligonol. This contains anti-influenza action and several important anti oxidants. Oligonol regulates the blood circulation and acts as a shield against the sun's harmful UVA rays thereby protecting lips from tanning. Pigmentation, spots and any kind of abnormalities are removed with a regular use of Lychee on the lips. What is Jojoba Oil? How is it beneficial ? This highly moisturizing oil is taken from Jojoba tree (Simmondsia chinenis) which is abundantly found in Southern California, South Arizona and North West Mexico. Wax Ester, as it is commonly called, Jojoba oil doesn't have the oil-like texture. Rather, it is similar to the oil produced by our skin's sebaceous glands. Jojoba Oil does not evaporate off the surface which makes it an excellent moisture locking agent, keeping lips hydrated round the clock. Chapped and damaged lips are intensively nourished and dryness is cured. Lips do not have oil glands. This makes it very important to keep them under a total moisture cover or else they fall prey to environmental changes, sun's UV rays and pollution. With Jojoba Oil lips become healthier, soft and have a natural shine. The presence of anti oxidants in Jojoba Oil helps in countering external stimuli, making lips pink. How does Shea Butter keep lips soft ? From the nuts of Vitellaria paradoxa or the Shea Tree which is found in Africa, Shea butter is extracted. Elevating the basic hydration level of the lips, Shea butter works its magic on the first few applications itself. This ivory-yellow butter promotes the regeneration of cells due to high content of Vitamin D. This makes it an excellent healer. Shea butter acts as a solid shield from sun, dirt, pollution and any kind of infections prevailing in the environment. Despite its look, Shea butter is anti-clogging in nature which means that it lets the lips breathe and absorb the most of all ingredients, not hindering the beautification process. Shea butter is anti inflammatory in nature and vanishes away dark spots within few applications. It is a natural sunscreen with SPF 6 and soothes the lips like no other. Why is Almond Oil important for lip care ? Since the lips do not have oil glands, they need extra moisture and protection from external factors. Almond oil is a great emollient which is known to regulate moisture balance effectively. Almond oil is easily absorbed and cures any kind of unpleasant sights- dry patches, chapped lips, cuts and bruises, that make the lips appear unhealthy. Almond oil is the perfect friend to brave the winter chill and harsh climatic conditions. It has a sweet smell and regular application of Almond oil makes lips soft, reduces any pigmentation, darkening and makes lips shimmer pink with health. moisturizing, pampering lips Naturally complete the look Lip Balm - Orange & Shea Butter Lip Balm - Mint SLip Balm - Strawberry & Honey Alternatively, you can also find many more products from the Vaadi Herbals Lip Balm - Lychee range.MRP: 58 Country of Origin: IndiaName of Mfg / Importer / Brand: Vaadi Herbals Private LimitedAddress of Mfg / Importer / Brand: A-40, Jhilmil Industrial Area, Delhi - 110095"
